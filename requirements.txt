Flask
# Flask is the Python framework we use to create the web app.
# It handles routing, templates, forms, and more.

gunicorn
# Gunicorn is a production web server for Python.
# It runs the Flask app on Render (or any server) efficiently.
# Better than Flask's built-in debug server for real deployment.
